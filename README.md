# Project1JSUregistration
This is my first project in Java. It is not fully complete but this project is a simplified version of JSU's registration system. Attached is a data file, in tab-delimited CSV format, containing the data for the Mathematics and Computer Science courses offered by JSU in the Spring 2019 semester.

Within the data file, each line corresponds to the data about one course. For traditional (lecture) courses, the data fields within each line are, in order: course name, CRN number, course number, section number, credit hours, starting time (in HH:MM format), stopping time (in HH:MM format), scheduled meeting days, scheduled meeting room/location, course type, and instructor name(s).

My task for this project is to implement a system which will allow the user to:
  •Search for specific courses in the database by course number, which should return a list of the section(s) available for each course. 
  
  •Register for a specific course and section by entering the corresponding CRN number. The system should not allow the user to register for classes which conflict          with each other (that is, classes that are held on overlapping days and times).
  
  •View the "trial schedule," in the form of a list of the courses that have been added to the schedule so far. 
  
  Each of these options should be chosen from a simple menu, presented to the user at the console.
